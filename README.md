# ACF: The American Capital Finder

## 1)	What problem does the app focus on?
“For hundreds of years Americans have been deserving of a learning tool that allows us and our children to learn the state capitols in an easy, responsive way.  

The focus of our app takes care of this in a fast, easy way. We call it the ACF: The American Capital Finder.”

## 2) How does your app solve this problem at a high-level?
“Our app marries two titan APIs: Google Maps (pause) and Wikipedia (longer pause) – and creates a stunning, focused, referencing tool that allows anyone, yes, ANYONE, to reference the American state capitols.”

## 3)	What steps did you take to build the app?
“Firstly, our Web Designer Justin took care of the front end, using Materialize to maximize the app’s presentation. Through the process of building the app, Justin ensured that the end design would meet high standards of practicality and quality.

Next, Nor, our Firebase DB Engineer, was tasked with building the database list and fleshing out the values of each entry. We knew that with Nor in charge of this no State capitol would be missed.

Rolando, the team’s Lead Developer, constructed the innards of the app, creating an on-click response that utilized Nor’s DB to return responses from the site’s two APIs that generated what the user would see as an end result: the State capitol’s information and a mapped image of said state capitol. 

Jacob, Jr. Developer, Jr. Programmer, Lead Tester and Presenter, assisted with the general functionality and testing of the site – ensuring that the app was meeting the expectations of the team’s goals and benchmarks.”

### Future updates will include more general information, an interactive non-static map, and a randomized functionality for students to test themselves.”
